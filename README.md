## Loyalty Program Next 
**Frontend of blockchain based modular platform for loyalty programs**

This repository is meant as initial playground to develop and test front end as I develop to solidity backend. 
Even though repository is public, For now, it is for personal use only. 

## Idea and Design

- Create an open and modular blockchain based framework for loyalty programs. 
- Aimed at small and medium sized shops and companies. 
- eventually deploy on multiple blockchains. 
- Design of solidity frontend is on my Figma. 

## Development / TO DO
### Detailed to do's are in each separate page.  
- [x] setup page layout of customer app   
- [x] setup page layout of vendor app
- [x] insert / develop todo.md file in each subpage. 
- [x] setup redux store / notifications 
- [ ] Build login page customer - use web3modal?
- [x] Build login page vendor - use web3modal?  
- [ ] build landing page customer: retrieve data from blockchain logs - to check what loyalty cards they hold. 
- [x] build landing page vendor: retrieve data from blockchain logs: what programs they deployed. 
- [ ] Redo images so they fit in sizes I need for website. 
- [ ] refactor login - do from topbar & notification menu. (if possible)
- [ ] 


## Yarn / NEXT 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
